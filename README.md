## Requirement
---
* Raspberry pi
* arduino
* Web Cam
## Setting up Raspberry Pi
---
 If you bought your Pi as part of a kit, you probably got everything you need right in the box, but if you just have the board, you'll need the following:
* power source
* microSD card (at least 8GB)
* keyboard (wired or wireless)
* mouse or other pointing device (could be built into the keyboard)
* monitor or TV to connect to (via HDMI)
* HDMI cables

### Installing OpenCV on Raspberry Pi
---
OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.

We’re going to install OpenCV on the Raspberry Pi for our Python project. Note: There are two ways to install this:

* Pip install (30 seconds)
* Compile from source (hours)

We are covering the Pip install here because it’s fast and easy. It will work for most OpenCV projects, and it’s an easy solution.
