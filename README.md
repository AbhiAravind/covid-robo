* Can be controlled by android app
* Disinfect itself
* visual and audio output
 
## Requirement

* Raspberry pi
* arduino
* Web Cam
* Rover
* Temperature sensor
* Pressure sensor
* Ultra sound sensor
## Setting up Raspberry Pi

 If you bought your Pi as part of a kit, you probably got everything you need right in the box, but if you just have the board, you'll need the following:
* power source
* microSD card (at least 8GB)
* keyboard (wired or wireless)
* mouse or other pointing device (could be built into the keyboard)
* monitor or TV to connect to (via HDMI)
* HDMI cables

### Installing OpenCV on Raspberry Pi

>OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.

We’re going to install OpenCV on the Raspberry Pi for our Python project. Note: There are two ways to install this:

* Pip install (30 seconds)
* Compile from source (hours)

We are covering the Pip install here because it’s fast and easy. It will work for most OpenCV projects, and it’s an easy solution.

## Android App for controlling the robot

The App developed using [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/)
>MIT App Inventor is an intuitive, visual programming environment that allows everyone – even children – to build fully functional apps for Android phones, iPhones, and Android/iOS tablets
